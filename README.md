Training Portal
====================

Takes input of user's database, and asks user questions about their database. Answering the questions inside Training Portal will improve the accuracy of CommandNet Processor.


## Contributing ##

TODO : A user must choose topics about which their database is. Whether their database is giving information about cars? or food? or what? This choice of topics is hardcoded inside source code. Bring this choice of topics in front end

TODO : A user must supply the user's database by firing commands in source code. Rather provide a UI through which user can import his database files (or zip file)
